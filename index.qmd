## Course Summary

MATL7355 – *Thermodynamics of Materials* is a 4 semester-hour graduate course. It covers the fundamentals of
thermodynamics (the three laws, state functions, closed and open systems, behaviors of solutions, phase
equilibria and stability, relations to phase diagrams, and other selected special topics) with the objective
of providing students with a thermodynamics background suitable for understanding transformations and microstructural
changes in materials that occur in materials processing and manufacturing. Emphasis is placed on metals and alloys in
their condensed states although gaseous phases are included where relevant. This course is a prerequisite for
MATL7360 – *Kinetics of Phase Transformations*.
