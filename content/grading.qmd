## Midterm Exam Grading

The midterm exams will be graded on a curve such that the average score is a B. However, I will not truncate the high scores
which means that scores higher than 100% are possible. This way, *everyone benefits* from the grade curving process.

For the midterm letter grade, the same grade conversion applies as above, however scores greater or equal to 97 will receive
the **A+** grade (unlike for the final grade, where **A** is the highest grade at Northeastern University).
