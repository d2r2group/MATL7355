## Primary Textbook

No textbook will be explicitly required. However, a large portion of the course will follow the textbook by Gaskell and Laughlin:

## Secondary Literature

There are a few other textbooks that can be of interest (and the last three are available on Amazon for about $10 each):

::: {.callout-tip title="Interesting classification of binary phase diagrams"}

## Learning Outcomes
This course will give students the opportunity to...

- understand the basics of thermodynamics including the 3 laws of thermodynamics and extensive/intensive properties.
- become proficient in applying the laws of thermodynamic on various processes (e.g. isothermal, isobaric,...).
- understand the concepts entropy, thermodynamic potentials (such as enthalpy and Gibbs free energy), work, heat, etc.
- learn the difference between exact and inexact differentials and the difference between path and state functions.
- master thermochemistry calculations and understand temperature dependence of heat capacity and enthalpy.
- learn the basics of statistical thermodynamics and what micro/macrostates are.
- become comfortable with implementing Maxwell's relations.
- understand and learn to read single component and binary (and ternary) phase diagrams.
- understand ideal and non-ideal gas behavior.
- learn the basics of solution thermodynamics (Henry and Raoult's laws and Hume-Rothery rules).
