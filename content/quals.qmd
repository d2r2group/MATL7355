title: Ph.D. Qualification Exam - Materials Concentration
---

MATL 7355 is a core course for the PhD qualification exam in MIE for the materials concentration.

## Information for Ph.D. Qualification Exam A, 2023

The *Ph.D. qualification exam A* of the materials science concentration will consist of two parts,
MSE1 *"Thermodynamics of Materials"* and MSE2 *"Kinetics of Phase Transformations"*.

::: {.callout-important title="Number of Questions"}
Each part will consist of three questions (six questions in total) and the candidate will be required to answer **exactly two questions** of each.
Each of the **four total questions answered** will be worth 25% of the overall exam grade.
:::

### Details on MSE1 *"Thermodynamics of Materials"*

1. The following topics will **not** be asked:

    - Open systems
    - Systems with magnetic/electric fields
    - Statistical Thermodynamics
    - Einstein/Debye models of heat capacity
    - Non-ideal gases and Van de Waals Gas calculations
    - Subregular solutions
    - Gibbs-Duhem integration
    - Ternary phase diagrams

2. **One question of MSE1 will be on binary phase diagrams.** So, make sure you understand them well.

3. Questions in MSE1 may have sub-questions (a, b, c,...) and will be of similar style to the homework and mid-term exam
(however, will be *unique* and not be an old question with different numbers).

4. Formula sheet will **not** be provided in this exam. However, all three questions of MSE1 will state the key equations
needed to solve the problem.
