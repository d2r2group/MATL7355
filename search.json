The promotion of independent and original scholarship ensures that students derive the most from their educational experience and their pursuit of knowledge. Academic dishonesty violates the most fundamental values of an intellectual community and undermines the achievements of the entire University.\nAs members of the academic community, students must become familiar with their rights and responsibilities. In each course, they are responsible for knowing the requirements and restrictions regarding research and writing, examinations of whatever kind, collaborative work, the use of study aids, the appropriateness of assistance, and other issues. Students are responsible for learning the conventions of documentation and acknowledgment of sources in their fields. Northeastern University expects students to complete all examinations, tests, papers, creative projects, and assignments of any kind according to the highest ethical standards, as set forth either explicitly or implicitly in this Code or by the direction of instructors.

It covers the fundamentals of thermodynamics (the three laws, state functions, closed and open systems, behaviors of solutions, phase equilibria and stability, relations to phase diagrams, and other selected special topics) with the objective of providing students with a thermodynamics background suitable for understanding transformations and microstructural changes in materials that occur in materials processing and manufacturing. Emphasis is placed on metals and alloys in their condensed states although gaseous phases are included where relevant. This course is a prerequisite for MATL7360 – Kinetics of Phase Transformations."
