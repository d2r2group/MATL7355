    "text": "Academic Integrity\nA commitment to the principles of academic integrity is essential to the mission of Northeastern University. The promotion of independent and original scholarship ensures that students derive the most from their educational experience and their pursuit of knowledge. Academic dishonesty violates the most fundamental values of an intellectual community and undermines the achievements of the entire University.\nAs members of the academic community, students must become familiar with their rights and responsibilities. In each course, they are responsible for knowing the requirements and restrictions regarding research and writing, examinations of whatever kind, collaborative work, the use of study aids, the appropriateness of assistance, and other issues. Students are responsible for learning the conventions of documentation and acknowledgment of sources in their fields. Northeastern University expects students to complete all examinations, tests, papers, creative projects, and assignments of any kind according to the highest ethical standards, as set forth either explicitly or implicitly in this Code or by the direction of instructors. Go to following link to access the full academic integrity policy: osccr.sites.northeastern.edu/academic-integrity-policy/. Specific examples of violating academic integrity in this course are the following (list not exhaustive):\n\nCopying another student’s homework solutions (a reasonable amount of collaboration among students is permitted, however not direct copying) or from online solutions\nUtilizing/acquiring/sharing homework/exam solutions from previous years\nCheating during exams\nNot citing sources/figures appropriately when writing the project paper (also, see the next section of utilization of generative AI)",

    "text": "Utilization of Generative AI\nGenerative AI tools such as ChatGPT or Bard have become widely adopted and I encourage students to (learn to) use it. However, similar to using Google to search for information, it is up to the student to decide which output is trustworthy/correct and which is false (“hallucinated” information). I therefore recommend always taking any output from generative AI with a healthy amount of scepticism and double-check other sources (and common reasoning) to verify and tweak the final output. Rarely is it advisable to directly copy-paste information from generative AI and use it as a final answer. For final project papers initial generative AI outputs to prompts have to be submitted alongside the final paper (to assess how effectively you took use of generative AI) - this enables me to grade your critical thinking skills and development of a subject. Details regarding this policy will be discussed during the semester.",
